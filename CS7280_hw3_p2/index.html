                                It is important that the colors of a visualization match the kind of data that they are intended to portray.
                                For <b>categorical</b> values, the most important factor is that the colors that represent different categories must be
                                visually distinct. The number of categories should be limited by the number of colors that people can easily distinguish.
                                Though there is no hard cutoff, fewer categories are generally considered better. It is important to use colors that differ
                                in hue but have similar lightness values, to avoid unwanted "popout" effects that might imply that one category is more
                                important than another.

                            The maps indicate whether rents in a given Boston neighborhood are above (magenta/red), below (purple/green), or at (green/blue) the median
                            values for the city (US Census Bureau, 2013). Gray represents neighborhoods for which there is no data. Using colors with different hue but similar values
                            (left) makes the data more readable. In the map on the right, the red areas exhibit a pop out effect, and dominate the appearance of the map,
                            possibly appearing larger as a result.

                                <b>Sequential</b> color schemes are best used for displaying ordinal data or quantitative data that shows a progressive change in value.
                                The luminosity (also called lightness, or value) is generally given emphasis in these color schemes, which generally use a
                                steady progression from dark to light across the color range. The colors in a sequential color scheme can be mapped
                                using either linear or nonlinear functions, depending on the data range and variations of interest. Light colors are
                                usually used to represent low data values, and dark colors for large numbers, but this distinction is not universal.
                                Because they rely on differences in value rather than hue, sequential color schemes tend to be particularly color-blind friendly.

                            sequential scale on the left shows a smooth increase in value, so that the highest-income areas are
                            most prominent on the map. In the rainbow map at right, the progression is less clear, and larger areas
                            (or those represented with primary colors) tend to pop out as being more important than the rest.

                                <b>Diverging</b> color schemes consist of two sequential schemes that intersect at an intermediate value (usually the mean,
                                median, or zero). These color schemes are generally
                                used when divergence from some identified value is the primary component of interest for the
                                visualization. In these cases, a single sequence showing low values as light and large values as dark might give undue emphasis to
                                one aspect of the data or another. Instead, a diverging color scheme sets one color (usually a neutral
                                color or white) as the critical value against which the others are mapped. Values above and below critical each follow a sequential
                                color scheme from light to dark, but each sequence uses a different hue. In this way, values close to the critical value are
                                de-emphasized, and those far from the critical value are shown as different colors that are easily distinguished.

                            Variation in rental prices for different Boston neighborhoods (US Census Bureau, 2013). Both maps use the
                            same green-to-purple diverging color scale. In the map on the right, gray represents "no data" and white
                            represents the median rental value. In the map on the left, white represents "no data", and gray is used for
                            the median price. Use of a color value for the median improves readability of the map, and avoids the appearance of
                            assigning value when there is actually no information for a neighborhood.
